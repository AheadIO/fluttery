# Fluttery

A Flutter package that helps with prototyping.

## Framing

Helps with framing user interfaces. For example:

`RandomColorBlock` is a `Container` that paints itself with a random color. This way a developer can quickly frame out a user interface with regard to positioning and sizing without worrying about the final `Widget`s.

## Gestures

### Radial Drag Gesture Detector

Detect dragging motion with polar coordinates using `RadialDragGestureDetector` in `fluttery:gestures`. It's a gesture detector that reports like a dial about the center of the child `Widget`.
