# Fluttery

A Flutter package that helps with prototyping.

## Framing

Helps with framing user interfaces. For example:

`RandomColorBlock` is a `Container` that paints itself with a random color. This way a developer can quickly frame out a user interface with regard to positioning and sizing without worrying about the final `Widget`s.
